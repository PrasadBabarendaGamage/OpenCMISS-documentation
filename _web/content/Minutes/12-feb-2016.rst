Minutes for 12 February 2016
============================

:date: 2016-02-12

Present: Soroush, Daniel, Oliver, Andre, Peter, Richard

Apologies: David Ladd, Chris, Hugh

1. User and developer intention document

   - need to consider how to present user/developer intention on website and across the documentation and help users navigate to the most appropriate documentation for their needs.

   - not every entry in intention table needs to be a separate page, will be overlap between categories of users.

   - opencmiss.org: could remove documentation category (section/heading at top of page) and add a “For Users” category and start guiding visitors to the appropriate docs.

2. Infrastructure status

   - Set up Jenkins CI for OpenCMISS to test things out.

   - Everything moving to GitHub

3. Manage testing status

   - current examples a mix of “tests” and demonstrations, some analytic tests that perform checks internally for accuracy, etc.

   - Daniel has taken a subset of examples (mostly analytic ones) and added them as “unit” tests in the Iron repository to kick start the process of creating unit tests for Iron.

   - CMake system can build and execute these tests as part of the build process.

   - Can later add ability to run external “tests” which grab specific examples and build/test them.

   - Doing this on Windows, Daniel found some non-API code in Iron that needed to be exported to get functional DLLs under MSVC - could be more that need to be exported for certain examples in future (Daniel added to the technical documentation describing this).

   - Not all these tests are currently passing on all platforms.

4. Migration pathway for OpenCMISS-Examples

   - migrating from current single OpenCMISS/Examples repository to the OpenCMISS-Examples organisation

   - current examples that have a single “example” in multiple languages (C/Fortran/Python) - e.g., Laplace. These should be grouped as a single example with single documentation and just different implementations.

   - other examples that have, for example, FieldML and non-FieldML version

   - not clear how to break up or group examples

   - mix of tests and demonstration examples

   - need to make sure that documentation isn’t needlessly duplicated across examples

   - How do these fit into tutorial/teaching applications

   - Use documentation development to drive the “creation” of examples, can then pull out appropriate examples and move them over.

   - All agree that current example repo left as is and then move examples over as required by the documentation development/evolution. Some of the multi-language examples (e.g., Laplace) can be moved now to ensure the framework is up and running in the way that we would like moving forward.

   - Examples could have their own tests if necessary, as well as the entire example also being used as a test.

   - “examples” which are purely created to test Iron functionality should be in the Iron/tests not OpenCMISS-Examples.

5. Branch definitions and intentions for OpenCMISS repositories

   - deferred.

6. Other business

7. Next Meeting: Wednesday next week (TBC)
